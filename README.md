Themes for SmartGit application

A list of custom themes for SmartGit.

## How to use?
You can install by going to `Edit -> Preferences -> User Interface -> Custom Theme` and point to the `.theme` file.

That's all!

You should see the new theme after restarting SmartGit.

## Caveats
I haven't tested it on platforms other than Linux. If it works let me know I'll update it here.

### Below is a screenshot of how it'll look like.
